Tax code calculation in Python 3.x.

The program allows you to calculate the tax code interactively (that is, by entering the data from the command line) or by passing it as parameters to the command line by invoking the command.

The syntax is 

`$ python cf.py <<first>> <<name>> <<last name>> <<sex>> <<comune>> <<date>>`

`gender` must be one of the following alternatives: 
- `m/M` if you want to indicate male gender;
- `f/F` if you want to indicate female gender.

`date` must be in the form `dd/mm/yyyy`.
